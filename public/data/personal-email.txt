Hi Team,

The times are difficult! Our sales have been disappointing for the past three quarters for our data analytics product suite. We have a competitive data analytics product suite in the industry. But we are not doing a good job at selling it.

We need to acknowledge and fix our sales challenges. We cannot blame the economy for our lack of execution! We are missing critical sales opportunities. Our clients are hungry for analytical tools to improve their business outcomes. In fact, it is in times such as this, our clients want to get the insights they need to turn their businesses around. We need to buckle up and execute.

In summary, we have a competitive product, and a hungry market. We have to do our job to close the deals.

Jennifer Baker

Sales Leader, North-East region
